#One of my favorite images!

You may notcie through most of my work this image, ![Nightwing Logo](http://DannyHunkele.github.io/myblog/images/nightwingLogo.png) showing up in many places.  It is the logo for my favortie superhero Nightwing.  You might know him as the first sidekick to Batman, the Robin named Dick Grayson.  As he grew up and outgrew his sidekick position he became a hero in his own right named Nightwing.  

The character of Dick Grayson is one of the best in comics in my opinion.  His humor and moral code and style are great and really speak to me.  He quickly became my favorite character.
