#Making a First Post

With this post I am testing some things just to see if all my styling changes will carry over into the new post like I expect it to.  Jekyll seems like it will be a lot of fun to use but man is it going to take a lot of practice to get started.  A whole different way to think and trying to combine so many things that I have learned in the Rockit class I am taking makes it a bit of a challege but it is still a bunch of fun!
