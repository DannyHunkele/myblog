#Explaining my art

In the years I have been doing art there have been two mediums that have really grabbed me, charcoal and watercolor.  Therefore, I would like to present to you some artwork I have created for viewing.  The gallery is divided into two sections.  You'll find the charcoal section and the watercolor section.  They both contain work that I have created over the years.  Charcoal is definitely my focus and watercolor is something I do enjoy playing with from time to time and would like to further develop.
